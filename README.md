# SC1015 Project

## About
This is a Mini-Project for the course SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). In this project we are using the [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) for our analysis.

Below is the step-by-step process of the analysis:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Visualisation
3. Data Resampling
4. Logistic Classification

## Problem Statement
- Can we predict if a wine is good based on its attributes?

## Conclusion


## What We have Learnt
