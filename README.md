# SC1015 Project

## About
This is a Mini-Project for the course SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). In this project we are using the [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) for our analysis.

Below is the step-by-step process of the analysis:
1. [Data Extraction and Visualisation](https://github.com/JonasChua/SC1015_Project/blob/main/Data_Extraction_and_Visualisation.ipynb)
2. [Data Cleaning and Resampling](https://github.com/JonasChua/SC1015_Project/blob/main/Data_Cleaning_and_Resampling.ipynb)
3. [Logistic Classification](https://github.com/JonasChua/SC1015_Project/blob/main/Logistic_Classification.ipynb)

## Problem Statement
- How do we know of a wine is good?
- Can we predict if a wine is good based on its attributes?

## Conclusion


## What We have Learnt
